🎉[2024-04] I’m thrilled to share that I’ve accepted a PhD offer from the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.
uk), funded by an [EPSRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc) DTP studentship, where I’ll be diving into research 
on object manipulation, robotic arm control, tactile perception and imitation learning.

I hold a M.Res. degree with distinction in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems from the [University of 
Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk), awarded in March 2024 and fully funded by the [Huzhou Institute of Zhejiang 
University](http://hzi.zju.edu.cn/site/main), as well as a B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from [Southern 
University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en), completed in June 2019.

With one year as a research assistant at SUSTech and two years at a startup, I bring hands-on experience from both 
academia and the startup world. I’ve also enjoyed serving as a teaching assistant for six courses at undergraduate 
and master’s levels.
Beyond tech, I have delved into the financial industry, completing an internship at an accounting firm, receiving a 
job offer from PwC, and working on AI industry investment research at a private equity (PE) fund, which has given me 
a deep understanding of the startup process and entrepreneurial experience, including insights into venture capital 
(VC). My long term goal is to build a tech startup.

My research passions lie in machine learning, pattern recognition, robotics perception, and computer vision. When 
I’m not buried in research, you’ll find me snapping photos 📷, hiking 🚶, playing soccer ⚽️, or playing computer 🧑‍💻.
