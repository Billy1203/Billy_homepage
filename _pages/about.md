I hold a M.Res. degree with distinction in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems from the [University of 
Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk), awarded in March 2024 and fully funded by the [Huzhou Institute of Zhejiang 
University](http://hzi.zju.edu.cn/site/main), as well as a B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from [Southern 
University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en), completed in June 2019.

With three years of experience as a research assistant, I have been deeply involved in cutting-edge research and 
technology development. Over the past year, I worked at SUSTech on academic research projects, and for two years, 
I collaborated with my advisor on a startup project that bridges academic innovation and real-world application, 
gaining first-hand experience in team management, product development, and technical execution.

In addition to my technical background, during a gap year after receiving a PhD offer, I chose to explore the 
intersection of frontier technology and capital markets. I completed an internship at an accounting firm, received 
a return offer from PwC, and worked at a private equity fund focused on AI industry investment research. This 
experience broadened my understanding of the commercialization process of emerging technologies, the startup ecosystem, 
and venture capital operations.

I am passionate about bringing advanced technology into real-world applications and enjoy working at the intersection 
of research, innovation, and industry.

My research passions lie in machine learning, pattern recognition, robotics perception, and computer vision. When 
I’m not buried in research, you’ll find me snapping photos 📷, hiking 🚶, playing soccer ⚽️, or playing computer 🧑‍💻.

- 😭 **2024-11** Unfortunately, due to ATAS clearance issues specific to the UK visa process, I was ultimately unable
  to proceed with enrollment.
- 🎉 **2025-03** I’m grateful to have received multiple fully funded PhD offers in 2025 to pursue research in robotics.
- ⚠️ **2025-04** I was excited about the opportunities, due to the sensitive nature of my research background, it is
  unlikely that I’ll be able to proceed with overseas enrollment. I still remain passionate about advancing robotics
  and applying cutting-edge technologies to the real world.
- 🎉 **2025-06** One paper accepted by IROS 2025 as an oral presentation!
