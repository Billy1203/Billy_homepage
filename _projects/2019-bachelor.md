> 🏆 Rank 2nd in the College of Engineering.

I was one of the inaugural participants in the Capstone Design project at the School of Engineering, where my team, 
under my leadership, achieved second place. My exceptional performance in the course earned recognition from Prof. 
Bi ZHANG, who provided me with a letter of recommendation.

<h2>💡 What is Capstone Design in SUSTech?</h2>

The Capstone Design (Comprehensive Design) project was inspired by the educational model for undergraduate engineering 
students in the U.S., and the educational approach was published in a Chinese higher education journal. My team and 
I contributed one of 
the featured case studies :)

<h3>Abstract</h3>
This paper discusses various models of emerging engineering talent training both at home and abroad, and summarizes 
the common characteristics of the models. In the context of deepening the engineering education reform and 
implementing the Emerging Engineering Education in China, the College of Engineering of the Southern University of 
Science and Technology launched a "Comprehensive Design" course as an integral part of its 
"Emerging Engineering Education". The course offers lectures featuring special topics and dual mentorship for 
industrial projects in order to comprehensively cultivate students having problem-solving 
skills, teamwork spirit, engineering ethics, and international horizon. In addition, the 
relationship between the university and industries is enhanced through the course.
