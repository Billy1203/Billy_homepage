This research project was fully funded by the Huzhou Institute of Zhejiang University. The other co-first author, Tao 
HUANG (ranked 1st), is a PhD candidate at Zhejiang University. I was responsible for the perception algorithms, paper
conceptualization, illustrations, video production, and addressing reviewer comments. Tao HUANG handled the planning
algorithms and hardware design. We both contributed to the simulation setup, writing, and hardware experiments.
