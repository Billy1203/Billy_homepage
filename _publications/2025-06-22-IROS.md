<h3 style="text-align: center;">Abstract</h3>
Novel view image synthesis for outdoor scenes has been challenged by inaccurate depth measurements, moving objects, 
and wide-angle rendering. In this paper, we propose an adaptive novel view image synthesis pipeline to generate 
realistic images of large-scale traffic scenes. The novelty of this work is threefold: 1) developing a set of 
high-fidelity 3D surfel model reconstruction methods with depth refinement and moving object removal schemes; 2) 
developing a self-adaptive rendering scheme adapted to different novel views via surfel geometry adjustment; 3) 
developing a hyper-parameter tuning scheme based on image quality evaluation to achieve better surfel model 
construction and adaptation. The removed back- grounds and other occluded regions within 3D scene geometric models 
are further inpainted using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The KITTI dataset and CARLA simulator are used 
to verify the proposed novel view image synthesis pipeline. Experiment results show that our method outperforms 
other approaches for large-scale traffic scene image synthesis in terms of computational efficiency and the quality 
of synthesized images.
