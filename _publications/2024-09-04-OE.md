<h3 style="text-align: center;">Abstract</h3>
This paper introduces USV-Tracker, a novel tracking system for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) tailored for 
practical applications such as surface investigation and target tracking. The system tackles three pivotal 
challenges: perception robustness, tracking concealment, and planning efficiency. The contributions of this work are 
manifold: (1) A multi-sensor fusion framework utilizing an Extended Kalman Filter(EKF) to enhance target detection 
and positioning accuracy, integrating data from cameras, LiDAR, GPS, and IMU sensors. (2) A two-stage path planning 
algorithm that generates occlusion avoidance trajectories and employs a virtual elastic force constraint to maintain 
appropriate relative positioning. In dense obstacle environments, the algorithm tends to get closer to the target 
and incorporates FOV orientation constraints to ensure stable perception. (3) A visibility-aware control strategy 
that ensures continuous target observability through EKF-based trajectory prediction. Simulations in Gazebo and 
corresponding physical experiments validate the system's effectiveness and robustness, demonstrating its 
applicability in real-world scenarios. The computational workload is managed on a constrained on-board computer, 
underscoring the system's practicality.
