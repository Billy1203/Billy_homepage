excerpt: 'The sensory system integrated on a prosthetic fingertip can identify 20 different commercial textiles with a 100.0% accuracy at a fixed sliding rate and a 98.9% accuracy at random sliding rates. The sensory system is expected to help achieve subtle tactile sensation for robotics and prosthetics, and further be applied to haptic-based virtual reality and beyond.'

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Abstract</h3>
Humans can gently slide a finger on the surface of an object and identify it by capturing both static pressure and 
high-frequency vibrations. Although modern robots integrated with flexible sensors can precisely detect pressure, 
shear force, and strain, they still perform insufficiently or require multi-sensors to respond to both static and 
high-frequency physical stimuli during the interaction. Here, we report a real-time artificial sensory system for 
high-accuracy texture recognition based on a single iontronic slip-sensor, and propose a criterion‚Äîspatiotemporal 
resolution, to corelate the sensing performance with recognition capability. The sensor can respond to both static 
and dynamic stimuli (0-400Hz) with a high spatial resolution of 15Œºm in spacing and 6Œºm in height, together with 
a high-frequency resolution of 0.02Hz at 400Hz, enabling high-precision discrimination of fine surface features. The 
sensory system integrated on a prosthetic fingertip can identify 20 different commercial textiles with a 100.0% 
accuracy at a fixed sliding rate and a 98.9% accuracy at random sliding rates. The sensory system is expected to 
help achieve subtle tactile sensation for robotics and prosthetics, and further be applied to haptic-based virtual 
reality and beyond.
